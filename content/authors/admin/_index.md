## About Me

Hola, I'm Miguel! Currently, I am a PhD student in Network Science at the Central European University in Vienna. I am very passionate about Complexity Science in general. In particular, I am interested in the data-driven modeling of social systems to study echo chambers, polarization, inequality, and other effects of human-Al co-evolution on social media. I like to expand my horizons and I am open to collaborate on topics that potentially can have a social impact and that can be addressed using the tools of Network Science, Machine Learning and Data Science.

In the past few years I completed my BSc in Physics back in Mexico (UNAM) and my MSc in Data Science at the Sapienza University of Rome. I also worked in the private sector as a Data Scientist at Vivanta. In my spare time I also volunteer at NetPLACE. If you're interested to give a talk, please reach out or fill the form on the website.
